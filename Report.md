# Results report

## Deep Q Network

- algorithm description
- list of hyperparameters (table ?)
- A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

## Dueling Deep Q Network

- algorithm description
- list of hyperparameters (table ?)
- A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

## Dueling Deep Q Network with Noisy Net

- algorithm description
- list of hyperparameters (table ?)
